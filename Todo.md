# Things to do

_Should be open issues_

- [ ] paginated response for requests retrival ([GET]/api/requests)

### Miscellaneous

- Maybe Book navigation path from Request shouldn't be popuated until books have been borrowed, so that we know which approved request has which books. A list of BookIds can be used to store the requested books until the request is approved and the Books property will then be populated with the borrowed books
